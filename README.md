This repository contains a collection of programs and documentation relating to Breakthrough Listen / Berkeley SETI projects on the GBT. Below I've provided a brief summary of what each folder
contains. 

**mars2020**

On Feb. 11, 2021, Steve Croft and I conducted a GBT observation of the Mars2020 spacecraft (with Mars as the off-source) while it was en route to Mars. In this folder, you can find a Jupyter notebook that I used to 
analyze .dat files generated by running turboSETI on the fine spectral resolution .fil file we obtained for that observation. In addition, there is a python script which can calculate
drift rates for any object listed in JPL Horizons given deldot values from the object's ephemeris file. Finally, there is also a PDF summarizing some comparisons between actually-measured
drift rates and drift rates of various spacecraft in orbit around (or on the surface of) Mars.
